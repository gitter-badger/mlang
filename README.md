## build & run & test

standard SBT project, run `Main` with file name to check, test with standard SBT commands

## code

* packages and files is indexed by "a-z", resulting in a linear order of files. you 
should be able to read them one by one

## what we have

## possible roadmap

## math

* quick sort and properties
* symmetry book
* cubical Agda
* Agda stdlib
* Artin's or Lang's *Algebra*
* Agda's test cases and it's issues
* https://ncatlab.org/homotopytypetheory/show/open+problems#higher_algebra_and_higher_category_theory
    * seems interesting: limits problem?
* https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT
* unimath
* the big problems list


## misc

* translate to Agda to do correctness checking
